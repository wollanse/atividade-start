    <h2>the vengeful one</h2>
    <p>He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
        It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
        Hear the innocent voices scream
        As their tormentors laugh through all of it
        No forgiveness from all I've seen
        The degradation I cannot forget
        So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
        For judgement falls upon you at first light
        I'm the hand of God
        I'm the dark messiah
        I'm the vengeful one
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        In the blackest moment of a dying world
        What have you become
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        As the violence surges
        And the teeming masses have been terrorized
        The human predators all gone mad
        Are reaping profits born from their demise
        The rabid media plays their roles
        Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
        Only too eager to sell their souls
        For the apocalypse must be televised
        So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
        For judgement falls upon you at first light
        I'm the hand of God
        I'm the dark messiah
        I'm the vengeful one
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        In the blackest moment of a dying world
        What have you become
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        When you die
        You'll know why
        For you cannot be saved
        With all the world enslaved
        When you die
        You'll know why
        You'll die
        You'll know why
        For you cannot be saved
        This world is too depraved
        When you die
        You'll know why
        I'm the hand of God
        I'm the dark messiah
        I'm the vengeful one
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        In the blackest moment of a dying world
        What have you become
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        I'm the hand of God
        I'm the dark messiah
        I'm the vengeful one
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        In the blackest moment of a dying world
        What have you become
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)
        (Look inside and see what you're becoming)</p>
